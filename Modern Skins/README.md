# Modern Skins

The information, skin files, etc within this folder are related to 'modern' aka Winamp3 / Winamp 5.x skins.

These skins are of a customisable and dynamic format (unlike classic skins which are of a fixed format) and are based around XML definition files in combination with the MAKI scripting language to provide a wide range of skins under this foramt. They can use a lot more resources (both memory and CPU) compared to classic skins due to the larger number of image files and related dynamic scripting support that can make them much more customisable over what Winamp natively provides.
